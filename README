License: Seshat is released under the license GPLv3 (see LICENSE file)

----------------
Requirements:
- Compilation tools: cmake and g++

----------------
Usage: ./seshat -c config -i input [-r render.pgm]

  -c config: set the configuration file
  -i input:  set the input math expression file
  -r render: save in 'render' the image representing the input expression (PGM format)

----------------
Modifications:
This version of seshat:
- Has no InkML support anymore (xerces-c dependency removed)
- No longer makes use of boost
- Requires  C++23 support in your compiler (std::ranges::iota_view, std::ranges::zip_view, std::ranges::fold_left)
  - Or at the very least, C++20 (concepts, std::span) with the ranges-v3 library to add the STL ranges missing from this version
- WIP: more modern memory management, less abusive usage of std::list. Who knows, might make it faster.
- As such, this is pretty much standalone, as long as you have a recent compiler and the Config folder

----------------
Fork goals:
To use this in a natural display c++ calculator as an open source Math Input Panel kind of thing.  
In this endeavour, the program will be turned into a library that should let you input mouse/touch strokes over time and get a list of possible results, for user selection.

----------------
Example:
There is an example math expressions in folder "SampleMathExps". The following command
will recognize the expression (x+y)^2 encoded in "exp.scgink"

$ ./seshat -c Config/CONFIG -i SampleMathExps/exp.scgink -r render.pgm

This command outputs several information through the standard output, where the last line will
provide the LaTeX string of the recognized math expression.

An image representation of the input strokes will be rendered in "render.pgm".

It should be noted that only options "-c" and "-i" are mandatory.
